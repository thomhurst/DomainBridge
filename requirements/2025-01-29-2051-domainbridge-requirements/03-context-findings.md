# Context Findings

## Overview
Based on my analysis of the DomainBridge source code and the reported bugs, I've identified key areas where the source generator may be failing when dealing with complex, nested type hierarchies.

## Reported Issues
1. **Missing Bridge Types**: "The type or namespace name 'PLACEHOLDERBridge' does not exist"
2. **Interface Implementation Failures**: "'PLACEHOLDERBridge does not implement interface member 'INTERFACE.METHOD()'"

## Key Files and Components Analyzed

### Core Source Generator Files
- `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/DomainBridgePatternGenerator.cs`: Main generator entry point
- `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/TypeCollector.cs`: Recursively collects types needing bridges
- `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/BridgeTypeResolver.cs`: Resolves types to their bridge equivalents
- `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/EnhancedBridgeClassGenerator.cs`: Generates bridge classes
- `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/TypeAnalyzer.cs`: Analyzes type members and interfaces
- `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/BridgeClassGenerator.cs`: Basic bridge class generation

### Architecture Insights

1. **Type Collection Process**:
   - TypeCollector recursively analyzes types to find all nested types that need bridges
   - Uses a queue-based approach to process types
   - Tracks visited types to prevent infinite recursion
   - Collects both explicitly marked types and implicitly needed types

2. **Bridge Type Resolution**:
   - BridgeTypeResolver maps original types to their bridge equivalents
   - Handles generic types by resolving type arguments
   - Uses fully qualified names to avoid naming conflicts
   - Critical for generating correct return types and parameters

3. **Interface Implementation**:
   - TypeAnalyzer collects all interfaces from `AllInterfaces` property
   - BridgeClassGenerator adds interfaces to the partial class declaration
   - EnhancedBridgeClassGenerator handles the actual member generation

4. **Member Generation**:
   - Properties and methods are collected including inherited members
   - Uses GetAllAccessibleMethods/Properties to walk inheritance chain
   - Stops at System.Object to avoid including base object members

## Potential Problem Areas

### 1. Type Name Collision/Resolution
- When dealing with complex nested types, the naming resolution might fail
- BridgeTypeResolver uses `BridgeFullName` which depends on proper namespace handling
- Generic types are particularly complex with nested type arguments

### 2. Interface Member Implementation
- The generator collects interfaces but may miss interface members in certain scenarios:
  - Explicitly implemented interface members
  - Interface members from base interfaces
  - Generic interface members with complex type constraints
  - Default interface implementations (C# 8.0+)

### 3. Nested Type Handling
- TypeCollector processes nested types but the queue-based approach might miss:
  - Circular type references
  - Complex generic constraints
  - Types nested multiple levels deep
  - Types with similar names in different namespaces

### 4. Namespace and Type Resolution
- The "PLACEHOLDERBridge" naming suggests the generator uses placeholder names
- This could indicate:
  - Failed type resolution during generation
  - Incomplete bridge type map
  - Race conditions in multi-threaded compilation
  - Issues with partial class generation ordering

## Patterns Identified

1. **Bridge Naming Convention**: 
   - Explicitly marked: `[TypeName]Bridge`
   - Auto-generated: `[TypeName]Bridge` in appropriate namespace

2. **Partial Class Requirement**:
   - Bridge classes must be declared as `partial`
   - Source generator adds implementation to existing partial class

3. **Cross-Domain Marshaling**:
   - All bridge classes inherit from `MarshalByRefObject`
   - Dynamic instances used for cross-domain calls
   - Return type wrapping for nested objects

## Technical Constraints

1. **Compilation Order**: Source generators run during compilation, so type information must be available
2. **Roslyn API Limitations**: Some type information might not be fully available during generation
3. **Generic Type Complexity**: Generic types with multiple constraints add significant complexity

## Areas Requiring Further Investigation

1. How does the generator handle types with identical names in different namespaces?
2. What happens when interface members have name collisions?
3. How are explicitly implemented interface members handled?
4. Is there a maximum depth for nested type collection?
5. How does the generator handle partial types spread across multiple files?
