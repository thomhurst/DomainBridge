# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the bug fixes implemented to resolve source generator issues with complex nested types and interface implementations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double Nullable Type Issue (`int??`)
**Problem**: Nullable value types like `int?` were being incorrectly generated as `int??` in method signatures.

**Root Cause**: The `BridgeTypeResolver` was treating nullable value types (`Nullable<T>`) as nullable reference types and adding an extra `?`.

**Fix**: Added a check in `BridgeTypeResolver.ResolveTypeInternal()` to detect if the type is already a nullable value type (`System.Nullable<T>`) before adding the nullable annotation.

### 2. Serializable Types Being Wrapped Unnecessarily
**Problem**: Types marked with `[Serializable]` were being wrapped in bridge classes even though they can cross AppDomain boundaries directly.

**Root Cause**: The `TypeFilter` was not checking for the `[Serializable]` attribute.

**Fix**: Added `IsSerializable()` method to `TypeFilter` that checks for the `System.SerializableAttribute` and skips generating bridges for such types.

### 3. Missing Interface Implementations
**Problem**: Bridge classes were not implementing all interface members, especially explicit interface implementations.

**Root Cause**: The `TypeAnalyzer` was not collecting explicit interface implementations and the generator wasn't tracking which members came from interfaces.

**Fix**: 
- Enhanced `TypeAnalyzer` to collect explicit interface implementations
- Added `IsInterfaceMember` and `DeclaringInterface` properties to model classes
- Updated `EnhancedBridgeClassGenerator` to generate explicit interface implementations correctly

### 4. Deeply Nested Types Not Being Discovered
**Problem**: When a type had deeply nested return types (5+ levels), not all types were being discovered for bridge generation.

**Root Cause**: The `TypeCollector` wasn't recursively processing all type scenarios.

**Fix**: Enhanced `TypeCollector` to handle:
- Static members and nested types
- Generic constraints
- Interface members
- Pointer types
- Dynamic types
- Type parameters

### 5. Namespace Conflicts with Similar Type Names
**Problem**: Types with the same name in different namespaces were causing conflicts.

**Root Cause**: The `BridgeTypeResolver` wasn't using fully qualified names consistently.

**Fix**: 
- Enhanced `BridgeTypeResolver` to use fully qualified names throughout
- Added `EscapeNestedTypeName()` to properly handle nested type syntax
- Ensured all type references use global:: prefix

### 6. Property Setter Type Mismatch
**Problem**: Auto-generated bridge properties were trying to cast between incompatible types in setters.

**Root Cause**: The property setter was expecting the original type but trying to cast it to the bridge type.

**Fix**: Updated property setter generation to properly handle both user-defined and auto-generated bridges:
- User-defined bridges can access `_instance` directly
- Auto-generated bridges need proper casting and null checking

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/BridgeTypeResolver.cs`
   - Fixed double nullable issue
   - Enhanced namespace handling

2. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/TypeFilter.cs`
   - Added check for `[Serializable]` attribute

3. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/TypeCollector.cs`
   - Enhanced recursive type collection

4. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/TypeAnalyzer.cs`
   - Added collection of explicit interface implementations

5. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/EnhancedBridgeClassGenerator.cs`
   - Fixed property setter generation
   - Added explicit interface implementation support
   - Fixed argument unwrapping for method calls

6. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Models/TypeModel.cs`
   - Added `IsInterfaceMember` and `DeclaringInterface` properties

7. `/src/DomainBridge.SourceGenerators/Services/DiagnosticsHelper.cs`
   - New file for comprehensive diagnostic reporting

### New Tests Added
1. `ComplexNestedTypesTest.cs` - Tests for deeply nested types and namespace conflicts
2. `ComplexInterfaceTest.cs` - Tests for complex interface scenarios including explicit implementations

## Breaking Changes
None. The fixes maintain backward compatibility while improving correctness.

## Known Limitations
- Async methods still cannot work across AppDomain boundaries due to Task serialization limitations
- Interface return types (returning an interface rather than a concrete type) are not yet supported
