# Expert Requirements Questions

Now that I understand the codebase, here are detailed questions about the expected behavior:

## Q6: Should the generated bridge class implement explicit interface implementations when the wrapped type uses them?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (preserves the original type's interface implementation pattern)

## Q7: When your type "EventSource" causes namespace collisions, is it a custom class in your project's namespace that happens to have the same name as System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (naming collisions typically occur with user-defined types)

## Q8: Should the bridge generator skip implementing interfaces that are already implemented by MarshalByRefObject (like IDisposable)?
**Default if unknown:** No (the bridge should implement all interfaces from the wrapped type for consistency)

## Q9: For interface members with generic type parameters, should the bridge maintain the exact same generic constraints as the original interface?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains type safety and compatibility)

## Q10: When the wrapped type implements multiple interfaces with members of the same name, should the bridge use explicit interface implementation to avoid ambiguity?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (prevents compilation errors from member name conflicts)
