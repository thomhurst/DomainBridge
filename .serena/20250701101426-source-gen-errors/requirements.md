# Requirements: Source Generation Errors Fix

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Error-Free Code Generation
- The source generator MUST produce compilable C# code without syntax errors
- Generated proxy classes MUST compile successfully in all supported scenarios
- All generated members MUST have correct syntax and accessibility modifiers

### FR2: Type Resolution
- The generator MUST correctly resolve and reference all types used in bridge classes
- Nested types and generic types MUST be handled correctly
- Namespace imports MUST be complete and accurate

### FR3: Interface Implementation
- Generated proxy classes MUST correctly implement all interfaces from the target type
- Interface members MUST be properly forwarded to the underlying instance
- Explicit interface implementations MUST be supported

### FR4: Method Signature Generation
- Return types MUST be correctly specified for all generated methods
- Parameter types and names MUST match the original signatures
- Generic type parameters MUST be preserved correctly

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Build Performance
- Source generation MUST complete within reasonable time limits
- Generated code MUST not cause excessive compilation time

### NFR2: Diagnostics
- Clear error messages MUST be provided when generation fails
- Diagnostic codes MUST help identify the specific issue
- Stack traces MUST be available for debugging

### NFR3: Compatibility
- Generated code MUST be compatible with .NET Framework 4.7.2
- Source generator MUST work with Roslyn 4.0+
- Generated code MUST follow C# language version constraints

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Source Generator Implementation
- Generator MUST use Roslyn ISourceGenerator interface correctly
- Syntax tree analysis MUST be thorough and accurate
- Code emission MUST use proper SyntaxFactory methods

### TR2: Type System Handling
- Fully qualified type names MUST be used where necessary
- Type parameter constraints MUST be preserved
- Array and collection types MUST be handled correctly

### TR3: Error Handling
- Generator MUST not throw unhandled exceptions
- Malformed input MUST be handled gracefully
- Diagnostic reporting MUST follow Roslyn conventions

## Acceptance Criteria
