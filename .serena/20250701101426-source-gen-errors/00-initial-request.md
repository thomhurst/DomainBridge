## Problem Statement
i need to fix source generation errors on complex types. there are errors around interface members not being implemented. and also namespaces already containing a definition for something.

## Context
The DomainBridge source generator is encountering errors when generating proxy classes for complex types. There are two main categories of errors:

1. **Interface Implementation Errors**: Generated proxy classes are not properly implementing all interface members
2. **Namespace Collision Errors**: The generator is creating duplicate definitions within the same namespace

These errors are preventing the successful compilation of projects using DomainBridge with complex type hierarchies.
